**Random Number Generation Project**
This project implements custom random number generators using Python, covering both univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributions. The key features include:

**Random Integer Generation (Using NumPy):**
Simple implementation to generate random integers using the numpy library for efficient and fast random number generation.
Gaussian Number Generator (Box-Muller Transform):

**A custom Gaussian number generator based on the Box-Muller transform.**
The function allows you to specify the mean, standard deviation, and the count of Gaussian samples to generate.

**Multivariate Gaussian Generator:**
This function generates samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
Inputs include a mean vector, a covariance matrix, and the number of samples (count).
The Cholesky decomposition is used for transforming standard normal samples into multivariate Gaussian samples.
